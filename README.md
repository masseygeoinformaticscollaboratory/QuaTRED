This dataset provides an entity and relation annotated set of tweets on disaster events. Annotated with 5 types of entities and 4 different relations among the entites, this dataset is specially designed to train models that will help raise situational awareness in first responders. As an annotated corpus, this dataset can be used in the training of NLP models that can tackle the complex problem of relation extraction in informal English as is commonly found in Tweets.
